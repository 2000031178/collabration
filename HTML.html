    <div style="background-color: rgb(80, 255, 159);"><p2><pre> Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
        Itâ€™s a combination of Hypertext, which defines the link between web pages, and Markup
        language, which is used to define the text document within tags to structure web pages.
        This language is used to annotate text so that machines can understand and manipulate it
        accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be 
        done on the text. </pre></p2>
